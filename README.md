# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem which is based on information about Titanic passengers. Aim is to predict whether they survived or not. General [description](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and data are available on Kaggle.

I have used comments in the entire code to give a detailed explanation of everthing I have done. Furthermore, I have used three prediction algorithms
1. simple DecisionTreeClassifiers
2. simple DecisionTreeClassifiers with max_depth, min_samples_split
3. Random Forest

The datasets can be [downloaded](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) from the kaggle website.

The best score achieved from running this code was .80383, making it in the top 16% of all the scores in this competition.
